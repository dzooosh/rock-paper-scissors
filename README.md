# Building the rock paper scissors game


## Todos
<ul>
    <li>Create a blank HTML document with a script tag (Hint: it is best practice to link an external .js file). This game is going to be played completely from the console, so don’t worry about putting anything else in there.</li>
    <li>
Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play. Tip: use the console to make sure this is returning the expected output before moving to the next step!
    </li>
    <li>
Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
    </li>
    <li>
Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).
    </li>
    <li>In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt.
</li>
    <li>Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked.</li>
    <li>Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.</li>
</ul>
